# Hangman

## Problem Statement

One of the interesting problems in NLP for healthcare is in handling medical coded term associations and spelling errors.So we are going to mimic the problem with hangman / dump charades like NLP word games. Your ML model should predict the correct word from an intentionally obscured word and its description (Hint). Our evaluation set will have incomplete words and their descriptions.

## Example 
**Input masked word** = DEM_G_A_HY </br>
**Description** = is the statistical study of populations, especially human beings. </br>
**Model prediction/output** = DEMOGRAPHY

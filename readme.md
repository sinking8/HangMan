One of the interesting problems in NLP for healthcare is in
handling medical coded term associations and spelling
errors.So we are going to mimic the problem with
hangman / dump charades like NLP word games. Your
ML model should predict the correct word from an
intentionally obscured word and its description (Hint). Our
evaluation set will have incomplete words and their
descriptions.
